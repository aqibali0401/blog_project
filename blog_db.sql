With the exception of the Lagavulin 26, all tasting notes are given after several drops of water have been added.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oban 12 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>56.2%, $115<br />\r\nCask: Freshly charred American Oak</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Unmistakably coastal. A savory start with sea salt and seaweed. Citrus and pepper are delicately balanced with a smokiness from the charred casks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: Surprisingly fresh and fruity character that was completely absent on the nose. Well balanced with the savory notes and a hint of wood spice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A medium finish of spicy wood notes and black pepper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 7.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lagavulin 26 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>44.2% $2,400<br />\r\nCask: PX/Oloroso seasoned first fill casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Wonderfully complex with oak spices evolving into heavier notes of bonfire and ash. Underlaid by a deep sweetness of toasted marshmallows, poached pears and blackberries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: A deep sweetness. Baked figs and vanilla. Fades quickly to make way for an oak spice and smoky notes that intensify over time. A classic Lagavulin texture with an ultra-smooth texture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A long finish as the peat take over your palate to offer notes of an empty cigar box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Singleton 19 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>59.7%, $175<br />\r\nCask: Refill American oak casks, finished in cognac casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Vibrant with citrus. Orange oil, lemon zest and raw honey leave the senses tingling with anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: Lots of spice with an oak-infused dryness. Pencil shavings and ginger, but the sweetness doesn&rsquo;t carry through from the nose. More water brings out a freshness of green apples and grapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A long finish with hints of ginger and spent tea leaves. The dryness remains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 6.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mortlach 13 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>55.9%, $125<br />\r\nCask: Virgin and refill American oak casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Freshly cut grass that is in-keeping with Speyside mixed with a tartness akin to marmalade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: A creamy texture with floral notes that evolves into a savory finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A long a complex finish that suggests something much older than its age statement. A powerful Speyside malt that does justice to the Beast of Dufftown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cardhu 14 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>55.5%, $150<br />\r\nCask: Refill American oak casks, finished in red wine casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Very sweet. Lychees, coconut and hints of cream sherry. An underlying note of chardonnay white wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: In keeping with the nose, sweet notes dominate. Grapes and red apple skin combine with oak. Extra water smoothens out the liquid further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A short and fragrant finish with spicy pepper and further notes of sharp grapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 6.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talisker 8 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>59.7%, $115<br />\r\nCask: Heavily peated refill casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Instantly identifiable as Talisker. Menthol notes mix in with the seaweed and brine that Talisker is famous for. A real bomb of a whisky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: What a hit. Big, bold and unabashed. The added peat gives extra fire to the traditional Talisker profile. An uncomplicated whisky with nothing too surprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: Smoke remains on the palate as other notes evolve from brine and salt to pears and pepper. An excellent alternative for Islay enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 7/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lagavulin 12 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>56.5%, $150<br />\r\nCask: Refill American Oak casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose:&nbsp;A heavy maritime influence that evolves into dark chocolate. Water reveals the underlying citrus zest with a hint of ginger akin to tequila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: An uncomplicated malt that delivers what you&rsquo;d expect from Lagavulin. Sourdough, freshly squeezed lemon and hints of bonfire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: Water extends the finish to reveal fruitier notes. Smoke clings on from start to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 7/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Royal Lochnagar 16 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>57.5% $250<br />\r\nCask: American Oak and European Oak refill casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: A good balance of fresh fruit and wood spice. Subtle notes and a mellow aroma suggest something far easier to drink than the ABV would have you believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate:&nbsp;An acidic texture, like drinking juice first thing in the morning. Orange zest comes to the fore before the wooded notes come through in a lengthy finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish:&nbsp;A long and woody finish that warms the body. A real winter dram that is best enjoyed in deepest winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 8/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.malts.com/en-gb/products/collections/special-releases-2021\" target=\"_blank\">malts.com</a></strong></p>\r\n', 'My own experience has been that the tools I need for my trade are paper, tobacco, food, and a little whisky.', 'William Faulkner', 'ewtwert', 1, 0, 0, '2021-10-22 02:10:08'),

Taking inspiration from them, we have revealed new depths of flavor and embraced the essence of each whisky&rsquo;s unique flavor profile.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.elitetraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Diageo_Special_Release_21_Lagavulin26_70cl_Bottle_IBC_refract-min-700x875.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each label and box has been elegantly designed by renowned digital illustrator Ken Taylor / &copy;Diageo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not be deterred by talk of limited quantities.

With the exception of the Lagavulin 26, all tasting notes are given after several drops of water have been added.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Oban 12 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>56.2%, $115<br />\r\nCask: Freshly charred American Oak</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Unmistakably coastal. A savory start with sea salt and seaweed. Citrus and pepper are delicately balanced with a smokiness from the charred casks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: Surprisingly fresh and fruity character that was completely absent on the nose. Well balanced with the savory notes and a hint of wood spice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A medium finish of spicy wood notes and black pepper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 7.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lagavulin 26 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>44.2% $2,400<br />\r\nCask: PX/Oloroso seasoned first fill casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Wonderfully complex with oak spices evolving into heavier notes of bonfire and ash. Underlaid by a deep sweetness of toasted marshmallows, poached pears and blackberries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: A deep sweetness. Baked figs and vanilla. Fades quickly to make way for an oak spice and smoky notes that intensify over time. A classic Lagavulin texture with an ultra-smooth texture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A long finish as the peat take over your palate to offer notes of an empty cigar box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Singleton 19 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>59.7%, $175<br />\r\nCask: Refill American oak casks, finished in cognac casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Vibrant with citrus. Orange oil, lemon zest and raw honey leave the senses tingling with anticipation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: Lots of spice with an oak-infused dryness. Pencil shavings and ginger, but the sweetness doesn&rsquo;t carry through from the nose. More water brings out a freshness of green apples and grapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A long finish with hints of ginger and spent tea leaves. The dryness remains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 6.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mortlach 13 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>55.9%, $125<br />\r\nCask: Virgin and refill American oak casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Freshly cut grass that is in-keeping with Speyside mixed with a tartness akin to marmalade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: A creamy texture with floral notes that evolves into a savory finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A long a complex finish that suggests something much older than its age statement. A powerful Speyside malt that does justice to the Beast of Dufftown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 8.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cardhu 14 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>55.5%, $150<br />\r\nCask: Refill American oak casks, finished in red wine casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Very sweet. Lychees, coconut and hints of cream sherry. An underlying note of chardonnay white wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: In keeping with the nose, sweet notes dominate. Grapes and red apple skin combine with oak. Extra water smoothens out the liquid further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: A short and fragrant finish with spicy pepper and further notes of sharp grapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 6.5/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talisker 8 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>59.7%, $115<br />\r\nCask: Heavily peated refill casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: Instantly identifiable as Talisker. Menthol notes mix in with the seaweed and brine that Talisker is famous for. A real bomb of a whisky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: What a hit. Big, bold and unabashed. The added peat gives extra fire to the traditional Talisker profile. An uncomplicated whisky with nothing too surprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: Smoke remains on the palate as other notes evolve from brine and salt to pears and pepper. An excellent alternative for Islay enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 7/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lagavulin 12 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>56.5%, $150<br />\r\nCask: Refill American Oak casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose:&nbsp;A heavy maritime influence that evolves into dark chocolate. Water reveals the underlying citrus zest with a hint of ginger akin to tequila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate: An uncomplicated malt that delivers what you&rsquo;d expect from Lagavulin. Sourdough, freshly squeezed lemon and hints of bonfire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish: Water extends the finish to reveal fruitier notes. Smoke clings on from start to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 7/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Royal Lochnagar 16 Year Old</strong><br />\r\n<em>57.5% $250<br />\r\nCask: American Oak and European Oak refill casks</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nose: A good balance of fresh fruit and wood spice. Subtle notes and a mellow aroma suggest something far easier to drink than the ABV would have you believe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Palate:&nbsp;An acidic texture, like drinking juice first thing in the morning. Orange zest comes to the fore before the wooded notes come through in a lengthy finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish:&nbsp;A long and woody finish that warms the body. A real winter dram that is best enjoyed in deepest winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating: 8/10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.malts.com/en-gb/products/collections/special-releases-2021\" target=\"_blank\">malts.com</a></strong></p>\r\n', 'My own experience has been that the tools I need for my trade are paper, tobacco, food, and a little whisky.', 'William Faulkner', 'Wisky,wine', 1, 0, 0, '2021-10-21 21:43:06'),
